# Maghub Data Warehouse Sql
This repo is a collection of SQL queries, most of which can be used immediately when dropped into [Maghub](https://maghub.com)'s Data Warehouse. 
Data Warehouse is a paid addon for Maghub, which allows you to build custom reports using any SQL editor.

We recommend you ask Maghub to set up your data warehouse IP to a cloud server and connect to it using Mysql over SSH. This allows you to access Data Warehouse with desktop tools like [Mysql Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) and [PopSql](https://popsql.io/), web apps like phpMyAdmin and custom scripts on the web, as well as third party analytics tools like [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/) and ELT tools like [Stitch](https://stitchdata.com)

You can find cloud VPS servers capable of running MySql, PHP and phpMyAdmin and allow access to desktop tools, starting at $5 a month, at [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/76aeda2ea03b) and [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=9ad732c6894c51d7b91afc7ab2c939ba909697e6)

Maghub also providers instructions to use Data Warehouse through Microsoft Excel, but these scripts have not been tested using Excel.
